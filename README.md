## Overview

**NovaSound is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, Audio Sharing App developed as a personal project with React Native CLI.**

**NovaSound emerged from a profound intentionâ€”to honor and memorialize the memory of the Nova party on 7.10.23. This initiative seeks to commemorate the lives lost tragically during the 7.10 massacre at the Nova party in Israel.**

**Throughout this project I delved into advanced concepts, enriching my expertise while intertwining modern technology with heartfelt remembrance. Beyond its core purpose, NovaSound represents the fusion of sophisticated audio sharing within a robust application, aspiring to immortalize the spirit of the party and honor the individuals whose presence was cherished but tragically cut short.**
